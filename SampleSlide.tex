\begin{frame}{Duality Between Reproducing Kernels and Measures}
Investigators: Fred Hickernell, Claude Hall

\url{https://www.overleaf.com/2459845262nsvdsvhrxqwp}
    
    If you have a reproducing kernel, $K$, then it seems to induce an inner product on a space of (distributions of) measures.

    A smooth integrand integrated against the Gaussian distribution does not seem to exhibit $\Order(n^{-3/2})$ convergence using scrambled Sobol'

\begin{frame}{Generalized Tractability }

Investigators: Fred Hickernell, Peter Kritzer

\url{https://www.overleaf.com/8571474828dwjmfhkfbkbr}

Attempting to unify the ideas of algebraic and exponential tractability.  May also try to include tractability on balls of input functions and on cones.

\begin{frame}{Connecting QMCPy with FEniCS}

Investigators: Fred Hickernell, Mark Klinchin (?), Aleksei Sorokin

Showcase how QMCPy can connect with a major software library.  FEniCS \url{https://fenicsproject.org} is a major finite element (FE) partial differential equation (PDE) solver.  Some uncertainty quantification problems involve solutions of PDEs with random coefficients.  QMCPy can provide the randomness.  Let's demonstrate this potential connectivity with a simple problem.

\begin{frame}{Bayesian Cubature for Higher Order Nets}
   
Investigators: Aleksei Sorokin

\begin{frame}{QMC/quasirandom nonparametric statistics}
   
Investigators: Mike McCourt

What sort of statements can be said about, e.g., medians and percentiles of distributions sampled quasirandomly (instead of the mean, which is the integral)?  Art wrote this ... maybe related?  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12676.pdf
If we can say anything about this, it would be cool
